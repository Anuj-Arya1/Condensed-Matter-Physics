# Condensed-Matter-Physics
This repository contains numerical implementations for studying electronic structure in condensed matter systems. Current work includes energy spectrum visualization, density of states (DOS) calculations, and HOMO–LUMO state and fermi level analysis for systems with varying numbers of atoms.
